Petarda Project
===========================

A simple particle system written with ProcessingJs

Considerations
---------------------------

- Project on index.html file. It can be loaded locally or visit it online at [http://hell03610.github.io/petarda/](http://hell03610.github.io/petarda/)
- Libraries used: [Processingjs](http://processingjs.org/) for canvas animation, [PureCss](http://purecss.io/) for css framework
- Tested on: Chrome, Firefox
- User can change the center of the emitter by clicking on the canvas
- User can play with particles direction by adjusting the speed max & min X,Y
- Some predefined values for speed are given in the quick mode buttons
- Density in system is bound to the lifespan of a particle: the more a particle lives, the more particles the system holds

Further work
---------------------------
- JsHint & minifie the code with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- Change speed ui inputs for sliders or similar
