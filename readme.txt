Petarda Project
===========================

Considerations
---------------------------

	- Project on index.html file. It can be loaded locally.
	- Libraries used: Processingjs[1] for canvas animation, PureCss[2] for css framework
	- Tested on: Chrome, Firefox
	- User can change the center of the emitter by clicking on the canvas
	- User can play with particles direction by adjusting the speed max & min X,Y
	- Some predefined values for speed are given in the quick mode buttons
	- Density in system is bound to the lifespan of a particle: the more a particle lives, the more particles the system holds
	- .git folder provided for a history revision 

Further work
---------------------------
	- JsHint & minifie the code with Grunt[3]
	- Change speed ui inputs for sliders or similar
